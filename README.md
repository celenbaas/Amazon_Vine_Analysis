# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

This analysis looked at Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.  I performed a deep dive on Apparel products.

## Results

•	Total Reviews: 33 vine reviews, 45,388 non vine reviews

## Summary

The Apparel product reviews data is not showing significant bias based on the Percentage of 5 Star Reviews for vine reviews being 45.5% and then non vine reviewers 52.3%.  To further explore this concept, I would recommend breaking out the data for each star review category from 1 – 5.  This would gain insights beyond only what I am seeing for 5-star reviews.
